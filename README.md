CLIMATE NOW : 

Climate Now is a very useful web application regarding our climate condition. Nowadays climate is a very serious issue as due to the pollution our climate is changing which leads Many serious diseases. So our main motive for this project is to inform the people about the real-time climate condition. Firstly, We will take the data from the environment and send it to the server. For now, as we don't have any hardware to make sense of the environment, we will call some APIs for our project. Then Our system will analyze the data and update it to our server. And as per the current climate condition, our server will give some overall public suggestion.

To get the climate details of any place we need to press the 'ADD LOCATION' button on the home page.
The dialogue box will pop up where we need to put 1. The name of the location, 2. The latitude of the location, 3. The longitude of the location.
Then we need to click the save button, Now the location will be added to the home page as a card, where we can get to know the overall climate condition of the location. we can add as many location as we want and those locations will be saved within the browser.

In each card, there is a 'Dashboard' button, if we click the button we will get the detailed climate condition of the area.
